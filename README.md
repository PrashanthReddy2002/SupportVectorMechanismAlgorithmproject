# PROJECT TITLE

Using the Support Vector Algorithm of supervised machine learning,predict "iris.csv" dataset to find out whether the species will be same or different.

# TASKS

TASK1:Preprocess the data in skit.learn library

TASK2:Load the data using sklearn model selection default argument

TASK3:On the basis of your dataset or data create,train,test and split your svm model

Task4:Implement the support vector mechanism classifier using svm_classifier.The svm must be "Linear"

TASK5:Train the classifier on the training data

TASK6:Find out the prediction value on the test data.

TASK7:Test the model with the help of accuracy,accuracy should be in the range of 0to1

# CONCLUSION

According to my Support Vector Mechanism model the species are Linear with the accuracy of 1.00.

Hence proved model was succesfully implemented
